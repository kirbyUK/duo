A small platformer game created for my first ever [WGD](https://warwickgamedesign.co.uk/)
two-week competition. It pulls most of the code from my first game
[platformer](https://github.com/kirbyUK/platformer), and some of the changes made in this
eventually found it's way back to there.

You play as two characters at the same time and must guide both to the exits so that they
both occupy their respective exit at the same time. I found the concept a lot harder to
design levels for than I was expecting, especially as the two-week limit gave me little
time to program in new features.

The music is [mIRROR](https://deltanoyz.bandcamp.com/album/bad-checksum) by DELTANOYZ,
released under Creative Commons 3.0. If you like or glitchy electronic music in general
you should check him out I really like it.
